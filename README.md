# Sum Experts: supporting you through this cost of living crisis. A financial consulting and educative app. (Software5_Group4_Project)

**Description:**
Python was used to develop the program for this application. The objective of the app is to assist users in fulfilling their queries to their finance-related questions, in relation to the present cost of living crisis. The users are able to insert their details into the program and select three features:
- Calculate a Mortgage
- View live Financial News
- Book a meeting with our Financial Advisors. 

The inspiration for this app was led by some of the group's sponsor, Zopa, a British financial services company. In addition, our team members all shared a passion for the topics of: banking, finance, and education, which led to the app's present concept. In an additional effort to take an innovative stance in developing a program to remedy a problem, the present economic crisis—'the cost of living crisis'— influenced and motivated  our decision for our theme. Because of this, since developing the app we are yet to come across another program like ours.

**Visuals:**
This app is purely backend, and when it is ran, the user is given textual instructions to support them in navigating the system.

**Requirements:**
-   Use of Python, API, DB in the project.
-   Build your own API endpoints.
